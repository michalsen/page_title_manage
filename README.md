This may be another non-module, but I found a need for it, so here it is.

This module provides a page where all the nodes with page titles set are displayed.
The checkboxes remove the page titles from the list to make management easier.
There is also a tab that shows all the nodes with page titles.

TODO -
 - Perhaps directly add/edit/remove a page title for a node.
